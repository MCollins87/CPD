### Oliver McGowan training | Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust | 9th May 2024
- Face to face training (via MS Teams) on the Oliver McGowan scheme.
- This training aims to provide knowledge and insight to healthcare professionals about Autism and Neurodiversity, following the failings in care to patient Oliver McGowan - a sevierly Autistic young person, who's medical symptoms were missed and dismissed, and Autistic symptoms were treated as "being dificuilt". 
- It is extremely important for healthcare professionals to recognise hidden disabilities such as learning dificuilties and neurodiversity. Recognising when somneone is being "dificult" or is struggling with underlying issues is vital in every setting, not just healthcare.
- By being able to identify these differences, it will allow me to treat someone with patients and understanding.
